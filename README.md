# ACustom Boilerplate
(Project name is prone to changes)

### About

This project is about a CLI application that provides you with a customizable
installer for my own Nextjs boilerplate's. 

It asks you whether to use TypeScript or JavaScript, what folders you want to include,
what linters and formatters to use and so on.

### Reminder

This project is still in heavy development and should not be used to initialize a project.
